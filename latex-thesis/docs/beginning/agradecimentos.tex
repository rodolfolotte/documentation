  We create an imaginary show inside our heads, a show that involves more frustrations than the hope of reaching our goal. They are daily struggles, daily failures, so many blows that at first we thought we had lost all this time, but actually, it has been taking you to the highest point, to the point of seeing that small failures were all part of the same gear, the conquest. The energy that always moved me was the disbelief in my work, the lack of support, the disloyalty from part of this department, and the fear of not being able to conclude. But that gear was also \textquotedblleft lubricated\textquotedblright~so many times by faith, family, innumerable friends, places, travels, and so many other events that made things a little less painful. And it is for these people that I toast and dedicate this work today. Thank you to look with me this brand new horizon.    
  
  During my PhD, I had the chance to experience the guidance, friendship, support, criticism, and love of incredible people. Everyone who shared this energy played key roles in my evolution and what I am today. Above all, God and Nossa Senhora da Aparecida. Faith and science, the most famous paradox. Lord did not give me the thesis or health, but faith on you will always be the fuel of my determination and hope.
  
  A special thanks to the great sponsors of this work, my parents, Raul and Zélia, and my sister, Claudia. I can not imagine this work, or anything else, being done without your cooperation or presence. Thanks for everything.

This great opportunity was undoubtedly a very important piece in the conclusion of this work. The Army Geographic Service Directorate (DSG), for their support for cartographic specifications regarding 3D mapping in Brazil. To the friend George Longhitano, G-Drones, for the cooperation in acquiring and providing the data for our experiments.
    
  Nobody inside this institute was a motivation for me more than myself. No one will motivate you more than your own determination and courage. This was the biggest win of my life, which will be small compared to my brand new challenges.
