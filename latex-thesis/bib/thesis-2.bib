  Abstract                 = {Variations of sediment type (grain size and refractive index) and changing illumination conditions affect the reflectance signal of coastal waters and limit the accuracy of sediment-concentration estimations from remote-sensing measurements. These effects are analyzed from numerous in situ remote-sensing measurements carried out in the Gironde and Loire Estuaries and then reduced and partly eliminated when reflectance ratios between the near infrared and the visible are considered. These ratios showed high correlation with the sediment concentration. On the basis of the obtained relationships, performing correspondence functions were established that allow an accurate estimation of suspended sediments in the estuaries from Syst\`{e}me Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre, Landsat, and Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor data, independently of the date of acquisition.},

The basic way of interacting with these methods is by invoking them from the command line. However, convenient interactive graphical user interfaces are provided for data exploration, for setting up large-scale experiments on distributed computing platforms, and for designing configurations for streamed data processing. These interfaces constitute an advanced environment for experimental data mining. The system is written in Java and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Statistical rituals largely eliminate statistical thinking in the social sciences. Rituals are indispensable for identification with social groups, but they should be the subject rather than the procedure of science. What I call the ? null ritual? consists of three steps: (1) set up a statistical null hypothesis, but do not specify your own hypothesis nor any alternative hypothesis, (2) use the 5\% significance level for rejecting the null and accepting your hypothesis, and (3) always perform this procedure. I report evidence of the resulting collective confusion and fears about sanctions on the part of students and teachers, researchers and editors, as well as textbook writers.}},

 ABSTRACT: The research involving computational methods for the
 extraction of roads has intensified in the last two decades. The
 procedure is usually performed through the analysis of images
 acquired by optical sensors or radar (Radio Detection and
 Ranging). The great advantage in the usage of radar images is the
 possibility of survering areas often covered by clouds, since the
 imaging by active sensors is independent from atmospheric
 conditions in the region of interest. The cartographic mapping
 based on these images is often done manually, requiring
 considerable time and effort from the interpreter. There are
 currently many studies involving the extraction of roads by means
 of automatic or semi-automatic approaches, however, each of them
 has different solutions for different problems, making this task a
 scientific issue still open. Among the advantages of using radar
 images, one can mention the acquistion of images regardless of
 atmospheric and ilumination conditions, besides the possibility of
 surveying regions where the terrain is hidden by the vegetation
 canopy, among others. This work comprises the semi-automatic
 generation of seed points located dose to the features of interest
 by means of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). We then employ an active
 contour method (Snakes) for the extraction of the roads centreaxis
 in a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) airborne image. The obtained
 results were evaluated as to their quality with respect to
 perfection, correction, and redundancy.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the capabilities of multi-agent systems are used in order to solve object recognition difficulties in complex urban areas based on the characteristics of WorldView-2 satellite imagery and digital surface model (DSM). The proposed methodology has three main steps: pre-processing of dataset, object-based image analysis and multi-agent object recognition. Classified regions obtained from object-based image analysis are used as input datasets in the proposed multi-agent system in order to modify/improve results. In the first operational level of the proposed multi-agent system, various kinds of object recognition agents modify initial classified regions based on their spectral, textural and {3D} structural knowledge. Then, in the second operational level, {2D} structural knowledge and contextual relations are used by agents for reasoning and modification. Evaluation of the capabilities of the proposed object recognition methodology is performed on WorldView-2 imagery over Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) which has been collected in January 2010. According to the obtained results of the object-based image analysis process, contextual relations and structural descriptors have high potential to modify general difficulties of object recognition. Using knowledge based reasoning and cooperative capabilities of agents in the proposed multi-agent system in this paper, most of the remaining difficulties are decreased and the accuracy of object-based image analysis results is improved for about three percent. },

  Abstract                 = {Definitive data on the absorption spectrum of pure water from 380 to 700 nm have been obtained with an integrating cavity technique. The results are in good agreement with those recently obtained by our group with a completely independent photothermal technique. As before, we find that the absorption in the blue is significantly lower than had previously been generally believed and that the absorption minimum is at a significantly shorter wavelength, i.e., 0.0044 {\textpm} 0.0006 m{\textminus}1 at 418 nm. Several spectroscopic features have been identified in the visible spectrum to our knowledge for the first time.},
